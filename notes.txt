updating minecraft forge, episode 7 letsmodreboot

starting mcforge version=="1.7.10-10.13.0.1208"

this mod will require mcforge, thermal exapsion or MFR,

this mod is designed to implement vanilla's crafting table repair of tools/armor in a new machine called the Repairatron3000.
it will accept any vanila item that can be damaged, such as a tool, weapon, armor, etc via pipes/gui and record the duriblity of the item.
it will add this duribility to an internal counter, and when that counter = 90%(i think the vanilla repair bonus is 10%) of the total item durability
it will eject a fully repaired tool. Config option for if you want it to be like vanilla where if you add 2 slightly damaged items together, you will wind up
with only one and loose the excess durability, meaning the counter gets reset after every ejection operaiton, or that the counter does not get reset
you may wind up with 1.5 tools worth of durability in the buffer. example is showing in psudo code the two options

//first option
buffer= 0
accept tool
record durability of tool
record total durability fo tool
delete tool
add tool durability to buffer
when buffer>= total tool durability*.9 then eject new tool and set buffer=0

//second option
buffer= 0
accept tool
record durability of tool
record total durability fo tool
delete tool
add tool durability to buffer
when buffer>= total tool durability*.9 then eject new tool and subtract total tool durability from buffer

The machine can only be used for one type of item and material at one (ie, it cannot be used to repair diamond pickaxes
 and gold pickaxes at the same time or it cannot have more than one type of material in its buffer at once) this is to
 hopefully add a bit of balance to the mod.

 the machine will be designed to be powered off of RF or MJ. maybe EU on request, but add a constant energy drain for EU so RF is more desirable

 the planned recipe will be shaped and will consist of storage blocks of the following types, coal, iron, lapis, redstone, gold, diamond, emerald, tin, and a machine frame from either MFR or Thermal expansion.
